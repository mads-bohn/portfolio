          <h3>I'm a motivated and curious developer with a history in customer service. </h3>
          <p>My <span className='bold'>passion </span>for coding began when I wanted to create my own website, and
            became frustrated with the constraints of no-code builders. Programming ignited my desire to learn 
            and solve problems. In 2024, I graduated from <span className='bold'>LaunchCode</span>, where I studied 
            <span className='bold'> web development</span>. Now, I'm looking for more opportunities to expand my 
            skill set as a developer. 
          </p>
          <p>My favorite languages and frameworks are <span className='bold'>React</span> and <span className='bold'>Java</span>. 
            I'm also skilled in <span className='bold'>SQL, Spring Boot,</span> and <span className='bold'>JavaScript</span>. 
            I use tools like Postman, Figma, and MySQL Workbench to create beautiful and functional full-stack applications.
          </p>
          <p>When I'm not at my computer, I like to go on road trips, camp with my friends,
            and create sculptures. I'm also involved with the local art scene in St. Louis, Missouri. In the future,
            I want to bridge my <span className='bold'>creative</span> nature with my love of programming in a design-centered position.
