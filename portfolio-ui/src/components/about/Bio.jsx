        <p className='bio-history'>My passion for coding began when I wanted to create my own website, and became frustrated
          with the constraints of available no-code websites. Programming quickly reignited my desire
          to learn and solve problems. In 2024, I graduated from LaunchCode's web development course.
          Now, I'm looking for more opportunities to expand my existing skill set in software development.
